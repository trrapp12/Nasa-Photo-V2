### DESCRIPTION

> “He insisted that stars were people so well loved, they were traced in constellations, to live forever”
> ― Jodi Picoult, My Sister's Keeper

*I have always loved astronomy.  One of the most transformative moments I had was as a young scout paddling on the waters of Lee Lakes near the Grand Tetons on a night devoid of any human source of light.  Above me was a skyscape of stars so impressive and immediate that if I stood up in my canoe I would have surely hit my head on the milky way.*

*So when I came to a point in my learning that I needed to learn how to connect to an API, I knew I wanted to connect to NASAs.  With hard work and many, many iterations, I now have a project that can take my love of astronomy and hopefully use it to inspire other people.*

### THIS PROJECT DEMONSTRATES THE FOLLOWING

- [X] Tracking multiple stateful components and multiple states within the same component, using .useState() hook.

- [X] Passing state from child -> parent and parent -> child

- [X] use useEffect() hook to update effects 

- [X] move from a purely Vanilla JavaScript app to a React App

- [X] use of ternary operators for conditional rendering of elements

- [X] fancy modal :smile: :smile: :smile: 

- [X] use Style Components

- [X] spread and rest operators 

- [X] automated scrolling effect

### CHALLENGES I HAVE OVERCOME

The original v1.0 was built on pure Vanilla JavaScript.  It demonstrated the following:

- [x] Use of vanilla JavaScript to connect to an API.
- [x] ```JSON.parse().```
- [x] Iterating through a JS object.
- [x] Use of ```Math.floor()``` and ```Math.random()``` to generate a random number between 1 and 10.
- [x] Use of ```querySelector()``` and ```querySelectorAll()```.
- [x] Use of template literals `` ` ``  and placeholders `&{}`.

This was a cool accomplishment for me to see an API bring back information for the first time.  It was pretty freakin' awesome!  But it was also a non-sensical display of JSON.  To get this into something that would work in an App I knew I would have to bring in React.  At that point in my studies I had no experience with it.  So by far the biggest obstacle was learning React.  

Specific things I learned included: 

- [x] Passing props from parent to child, parent to grandchild, and child to parent
- [x] Using useEffect to create changes based off of state
- [x] Combining ternary operators and props to render different possibilities based on props
- [x] Setting up a favorites section that would save favorites after you closed required passing information stored in state and setting it in localStorage
- [x] Setting up a way to share with friends using the Navigator API was fine enough until I wanted to pass a photo as well, which then required learning how to use a blob so I could pass a file, something I had never done before.

### MY OWN PERSONAL CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDED

- [X] all work is completely my own.  The only directions were user stories the assignment needed to complete.
